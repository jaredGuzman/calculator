# Calculator

A basic calculator built using HTML, CSS, & Javascript.

It uses basic regex input validation, input and output storage using a string parser, and some basic calculation logic. It's not the absolute prettiest code, but it's mine! 

A link to the project can be found [here](https://jaredguzman.github.io/calculator/)!
